# SSH client demo with xterm.js, Spring Boot and Apache Mina SSHD

- Execute it (as jar or with maven or whatever).
- Open http://localhost:8080/
- Enjoy

This demo uses fetch for some things and WebSockets for other things, with long-request backup thanks to SockJS for the case WebSockets does not work in your system.

I think it can run any command and interactive terminal applications with ansi colors and animations, like htop or bash.
